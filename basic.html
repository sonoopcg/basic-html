        From 1992 to
         1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal s
         cientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in 
         the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero,
          although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called
           Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society 
           in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as
          a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.</p>
